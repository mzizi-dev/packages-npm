/**
 * check-canon-parity — CI-ONLY gate: does the committed snapshot still match
 * live canon?
 *
 * This is the ONLY script in the repo that touches the network, and it is
 * deliberately not wired into any build, prepack, postinstall or runtime path.
 * A token package that phones home to render a page is a page that goes blank
 * when api.mzizi.dev has a bad afternoon.
 *
 * The build-time gate is `pnpm tokens:check`, which is offline and compares
 * the generated files to the generator. This one compares the snapshot to the
 * upstream it was taken from, so a canon change shows up as a red CI job on a
 * scheduled run rather than as a surprise the next time someone regenerates.
 *
 * Refuses to run outside CI unless --force, so it cannot quietly creep into
 * somebody's build script.
 *
 *   pnpm canon:parity              (in CI)
 *   pnpm canon:parity -- --force   (locally, on purpose)
